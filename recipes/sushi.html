    <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), such as seafood—often raw—and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]</p>
	<h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li> Rice Vinegar</li>
        <li> Veggies </li>
        <li> Seaweed Wrap</li>
        <li> Sesame Seeds </li>
        <li> Rice </li>
        <li> Wasabi</li>
        <li> Pickled Ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Japanese sushi rice. This can be done either in a rice cooker or on the stove. Allow rice to cool.</li>
        <li>Cover bamboo mat with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Cut nori sheet in half. Lay nori shiny side down, on a bamboo mat covered in plastic wrap. Spread about ¾ cup of rice evenly on the nori sheet. If needed, wet hands to help spread the rice. If desired, sprinkle with ½ tablespoon of white or black sesame seeds, making sure they adhere to the rice.</li>
        <li>Flip the nori over (rice side facing down). Place fillings along the bottom of the nori.</li>
        <li>Grab the nori and the rolling mat. Fold the nori over until it touches itself. Continue rolling until a complete roll is formed. Squeeze gently, but firmly. Repeat with the remaining rolls.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a cutting board. With a very sharp knife, slice roll into 6 - 8 slices. Wipe knife on a damp cloth in between each cut to keep the rice from sticking.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with wasabi and pickled ginger.</li>
    </ol>
